# Preparation

To have a properly working dev environment, you should set up `dnsmasq` to resolve `loom-lang.dev` domains to your ingress gateway's external IP address.

When using WSL, it is possible to use nginx installed on the WSL system to forward requests to the load balancer's external IP, making it possible to reach services from the host Windows system.

Document the `enroll-flux-in-linkerd.sh` script.
